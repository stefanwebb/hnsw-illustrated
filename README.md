# HNSW Illustrated

This repo contains a simple implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm for indexing and searching vector spaces, for instance, in a vector database like [Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md).

It includes methods to visualize the construction and search algorithms.
